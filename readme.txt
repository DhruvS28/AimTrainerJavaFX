Assignment 4 ~ dhs404


Overall
	Part 1 
		I believe all elements of this part are working, except for the selection by lasso
			- only the selection of multiple items together by rubberband is working
			- the user can draw the lasso, but it is basically useless


	Part 2 
		I believe all elements of this part are working.
			- there is one bug to mention, upon deleting an item (or cutting), it is not drawn visually
			- however it still reacts to the mouse event and can be selected, I could not find a way around it

	Part 3 
		I believe all elements of this part are working.
			- one thing to mention, this solution does not exactly make a "deep copy"
			- since there are very few data values, those are just stored and used as needed, without a literal copy made


	Part 4 
		I believe all elements of this part are working.
			- one visual issue, the graph does not expand to fit the dimensions of the scene
